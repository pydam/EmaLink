# EmaLink

A device that bridges the communication between Loop software application and Omnipod and Medtronic insulin pumps. This is a fork from RileyLink, focusing on reducing size of the device, improving communication range and extending battery life. Also, you can charge EmaLink with any micro USB charger - much broader available vs. the mini port USB used by RileyLink.

### Charging

You can use any micro USB charges from a phone, tablet, headset or other devices. You can even use a powerbank to charge it if it has a micro USB cable. 
Charging is considered finished after the red led (the one close to the USB connector) is turning off. It may take up to 3 hours for Nano or Micro to fully charge, up to 5 hours for Standard or Maxx.

### LED Lights

There are 3 leds on the back of the device: a red one, close to the micro USB charing port, and a red + green cluster on the other side. 
When you switch-on EmaLink, the red + green cluster will light-up for 1 second. 
When you connect EmaLink to AAPS on Loop over bluetooth, the green led will start blinking every 3 seconds. The green led will stop blinking once battery is almost depleted.
The red led will start blinking once battery is almost depleted, you should consider charging it in the next few hours.

### Case

I have designed a new case to be 3D printed with TPU material. TPU is a flexbile material that cannot be shattered, this makes EmaLink
drop proof. There are several case styles to chose from, pick the one that makes most sense for your needs.

Chosing the right version:
* "I would like to keep EmaLink on my bracelet" - Pico is the right choice
* "I keep EmaLink with me most time, the smaller - the better" - Nano is the way to go
* "Having the best range while keeping a small size is important to me" - Micro is the perfect fit
* "Give me a product that has great range, can be charged once per week and can survive through drops and splashes" - Standard fits the bill
* "I keep forgeting to charge devices, can I have the biggest battery?" - Go for Maxx 

As of Apr 2021, the following EmaLink versions are available:

    * Loop/FreeAPS with Medtronic 523, 554, 723 or 754 pumps  - 16-18 hours (due to MySentry feature, EmaLink uses much more power, which impacts the battery life); With MySentry disabled, battery life increases to 5 days
    * Loop/FreeAPS with other Medtronic pumps: 5 days
    * AndroidAPS with Omnipod pods: 7 days
    * AndroidAPS with Medtronic pumps: 3 days
    
**EmaLink Nano** (PCB: 5.x, Battery: 250mAh)
![Case](https://github.com/sks01/EmaLink/blob/master/pictures/Pico.png)
*	This is a smallest version of EmaLink that ofers a weekly charging cycle. The antenna was optimized for keeping it close to your body. It still have a good range while kept around you (nightstand, desk) but for maximum range you should opt for Standard or Micro. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bE5cdci4nX8)
*  Size: 41x31x12mm dustproof, splash resistant
*	Weight: 18g

### Firmware

The code in the [firmware](https://github.com/sks01/emalink/tree/master/firmware) directory runs on the hardware.  There are two main chips and thus two firmware images.
Check the "EmaLink 3_7 3_8 - firmware update guide.docx" if you would like to understand how you can update the firmware for EmaLink with PCB version 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9.

Check the "EmaLink 3_2 3_3 - firmware update guide.docx" if you would like to understand how you can update the firmware for EmaLink with PCB version 3.2 or 3.3. You can use breadboard wires also but you may need to keep them at an angle while flashing as the PCB holes are slightly bigger.

Check the "EmaLink%204_4%20-%20firmware%20update%20guide.pdf" if you would like to understand how you can update the firmware for EmaLink with PCB version 4.x.
